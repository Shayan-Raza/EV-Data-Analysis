    "Electric cars run at least partially on electricity. Unlike conventional vehicles that use a gasoline or diesel-powered engine, electric cars and trucks use an electric motor powered by electricity from batteries or a fuel cell. In terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, electric cars and trucks are often cleaner than even the most efficient conventional vehicles. Exactly how clean depends on the type of vehicle and the source of the electricity. When battery electric EVs are powered by the cleanest electricity grids, greenhouse gas emissions from EVs are comparable to a car getting over 100 miles per gallon. When charged exclusively with renewable electricity like solar or wind, charging and operating an EV can be nearly emission free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though electric cars can be more expensive to purchase than their conventional counterparts, the higher upfront cost is often reduced through federal and state incentives. The cost to refuel an electric car can also be a fraction of the cost of gasoline, meaning that electric cars can have a lower total cost of ownership. Switching to an electric car can save on average over $700 a year in fueling costs, and over one thousand dollars a year in some cities.\n",
